# go-http-server

The app.go file can be run using:  
`go run app.go`  
or  
    `go build app.go`  
    `./app (linux)`  
    `./app.exe (windows)`  

Running the app.go file hosts a webpage (/static/index.html) on port 9090  


## A brief look at the code is shown below:

A function which fills a http webpage with the following plain text
```
func write_text(wrt http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        wrt.Write([]byte("This is a GO Line HTTP Server\n"))
        wrt.Write([]byte("Hello World"))
}
```

Method which serves files in the static directory and assigns them to the url /  
`http.Handle("/", http.FileServer(http.Dir("static")))`  
Method which serves the function "write_text" and assigns output to the url "/text"  
`http.HandleFunc("/text", write_text)`  
Serve webpages on port 9090 and handle errors  
```
if err := http.ListenAndServe(":9090", nil); err != nil {
panic(err)
}
```
